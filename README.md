# Google Hash Code 2019

## Problem statement 
Visit https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode to read the 2019 Google Hash Code problem statement

## Running the script
Run the script using 
python3 main.py <inputfile> <outputfile> 

## Solution
This code was used to find the solution to the Hash Code problem. It is written in Python and uses a randomized approach to find the best solution within a specified number of steps.

## Improvements
Some improvements to the algorithm will be to pair vertical photos together so that they are more similar or dissimilar to one another (i.e. have different or similar sets of tags)
Use a greedy approach alongside the randomized approach to greedily choose the next best-matching photo.
